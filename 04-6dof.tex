\section{Chassis description}
\label{sec:body}
The car is modeled as a rigid body suspended over four springs.
The rigid body represent all the mass of the vehicle including dri
Each spring represents the suspension of one of the wheels, with one end attached to the
The springs are constrained in the vertical orientation, but are allowed to slide with the lower end

\section{Limitations}
\label{sec:6doflimits}
While this model benefits from the simplicity of it's description
The main limitation of this model is the lack of the wheel rotational dynamics, which leads to missing reaction torques present during acceleration and braking.
